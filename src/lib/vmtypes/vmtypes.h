/* ENUM SIZES

 Crescendo enums are variable size.
 For compatibility, we need at least 16 bits to be allocated in some cases
 ( possibly all ).

 Need the parameter to get unique symbols otherwise kalcc complains. Adding
 __LINE__ might help but a header with an enum on the same line would fail.
 Sigh.
.
 Also looked at a macro that could sit at the head of the enum. Unfortunately,
 we end up needing to define a value as -1 to ensure the first real enum value
 is zero. That is fine, but means you are limited to 15 bit enum values 
 otherwise compiler overflows to a long type. Cannot fit -1 and 32768 
 into 16 bits.
 
 Could define the macro to specify 3 enums 
        dummy1  // With whatever the next value was 
        0x7FFFu // 15 bits 
        dummy = dummy1-1 // forces enum following to continue earlier sequence 
*/

#else /* HYDRACORE */

For xap we want to leave things alone so define the end enum to be 0

 *  The SIZEOF_OPERATOR_MESSAGE macro is used to determine the length of a message passed to the OperatorMessage API.
 *  On legacy (Gordon, Rick) systems sizeof() always returns the number of uint16 in a structure. On Crescendo,
 *  it returns the number of bytes. This is nort what is required for crescendo.
 *  The OperatorMessage API expects the message length to always be reported in number of uint16s, regardless of platform.
 *  When sending messages that contain no paramters always declare message id to be uint16, otherwise it is likely to
 *  default to a uint32.
